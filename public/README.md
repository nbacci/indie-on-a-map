# Indie on a Map maps the pulse of your band! #

Indie on a Map is a Sinatra app that uses the Twitter Search API and D3 data visualizations to create interactive, real-time state-level heat maps to visualize where a band is trending on Twitter.

This project was inspired by up and coming musicians and Indie bands who want to track where their music is most popular, so they can better connect with new audiences.
